# 	:loud_sound: SoundsExtractor 1.0

This simple app made for fun just to figure out "how images are sounds".  
To make it work NAudio library was used in this project (https://github.com/naudio/NAudio).
You can see (hear) example result of such image procession in SoundsExtractor/Example folder.  
Result sound may be strange or creepy, but is as it is.	:fearful:

## Usage:
1. Build "SoundsExtractor.CLI" project:  
```dotnet build``` 
2. Run with arguments as example below:  
```SoundsExtractor.CLI.exe [input .jpg image absolute file path] [output .wav absolute file path]```
